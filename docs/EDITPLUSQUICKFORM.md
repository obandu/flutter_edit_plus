# The EDITPLUSQUICKFORM
The EditPlusQuickForm is a Material Form widget that takes in [EditPlusFormWidget](./EDITPLUSFORMWIDGET.md) widget definitions and creates a form with widgets that support validation and saving. This is useful to create simple forms that are of a uniform appearance.

## BACKGROUND
Most of the time input forms require a simple design to perform the function of entering data, validating data as either correct or available and saving the data to the form state. This widget allows easy composing of forms by entering widgets by name and type.
