A flutter library package containing material widgets enhanced for convenient use in forms or input pages. The widgets can be used with both Stateless and Stateful (forms) widgets and include:

1. Data Table - connected to a bloc and works in both read only or read write modes. It comes with the ability to create new rows and save data directly to a data source over REST API. Can also be easily engineered to work with firebase firestore. It is connected to a specific bloc which is part of the library.
2. Date Entry Text Form - TextFormField from the material library modified to allow easy date entry with a date picker.
Allows for form validation.
